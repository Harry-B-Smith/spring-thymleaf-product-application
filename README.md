# spring-thymleaf-product-application
This is a project I completed in my FDM Training where the objective was to get hands on experience building an application from scratch using Spring Boot and Thymeleaf. This was my first time building an app using Thymeleaf. I have had experience with Spring Boot, as you can see from my other projects.
